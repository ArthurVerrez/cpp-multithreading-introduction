# C/C++ Multi-threading training [French]
The goal of this repo is to give a set of exercises of multi-threading in C/C++ and to benchmark it with Python and Java.

This was done in the context of the course of software architecture of computers of Mines de Paris in 2020.

The goal is to not use any library of a higher level than **posix thread**.

Please refer to *documentation.pdf* for the exercises. You can see a proposed solution for each exercise in the *solutions* folder.
